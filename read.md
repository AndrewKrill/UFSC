## Synopsis

Unfavorable Semicircle was the name of a channel on YouTube which garnered attention for the huge number of videos it published and the unusual nature of the videos over the course of a year. The account went live on March 30, 2015 and began posting extremely frequently, with two or three videos being published every two minutes.

Tens of thousands of videos were posted on the channel while it was active, some only a few seconds long, others as long as eleven hours. All featured abstract images and were either silent or contained distorted voices and unusual sounds.
